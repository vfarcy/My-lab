“I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, that's the great puzzle!”

― Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland

I tweet as [@VF4rcy](https://twitter.com/VF4rcy), randomly in French or English, about #lifehacking #education2.0 #startups #innovation #frenchtech and #IoT, way more often than I post on [my blog](www.farcy.me).
