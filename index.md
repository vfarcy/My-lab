Who in the world am I supposed to be ?
=======

“I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, that's the great puzzle!”

― Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland

It seems that I tweet as @VF4rcy, randomly in French or English, about #lifehacking #education2.0 #startups #innovation #frenchtech and #IoT, way more often than I post on my blog. 

So, you can follow me on twitter.  [gimmick:twitterfollow](VF4rcy)
